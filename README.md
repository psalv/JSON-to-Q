# JSON-to-Q
Makes generating Q cards easy.

Simply type your Q cards into JSON format and you drag and drop the file to load it.

If you would rather just learn about various programming languages and compiler design, feel free
to use the included JSON format that is included with the website.

Format of JSON file for uploading:

    {  
      "description": "The title of the Q card set",
      "questions": [
         {
            "question": "The first question",
            "answer": "Answer",
            "note": "optional note"
         },
         {
            "question": "The next question",
            "answer": "Answer",
            "note": "optional note"
         }
       ]
    }
